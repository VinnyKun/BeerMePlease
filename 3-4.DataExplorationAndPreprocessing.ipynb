    "# Beer Recommender System: Data Exploration and Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook represents the foundational phase of a hybrid beer recommender system project. The primary objective at this stage is to perform exploratory data analysis and preprocessing in preparation for building both collaborative filtering and content-based recommendation models using deep learning techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Source\n",
    "The dataset utilized in this project is publicly available on Kaggle:  \n",
    "**Beers, Breweries, and Beer Reviews**  \n",
    "Link: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ehallmar/beers-breweries-and-beer-reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ehallmar/beers-breweries-and-beer-reviews)\n",
    "\n",
    "It comprises the following components:\n",
    "- `beers.csv`: Provides metadata for each beer, including style, alcohol by volume (ABV), and availability information.\n",
    "- `breweries.csv`: Contains details about breweries, such as their geographical location and operational type.\n",
    "- `reviews.csv`: Consists of more than 2 million user-submitted reviews, featuring numerical ratings, review text, user IDs, and timestamps.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective of This Notebook\n",
    "The aim of this notebook is to:\n",
    "- Load and verify the integrity of the raw data\n",
    "- Clean and filter out incomplete or inconsistent records\n",
    "- Merge datasets to create a unified structure for analysis\n",
    "- Engineer a cleaned dataset tailored for recommendation modeling\n",
    "- Extract preliminary insights related to user behavior and beer popularity\n",
    "\n",
    "The outputs generated in this phase are intended to support the development and evaluation of both collaborative and content-driven recommendation strategies in later stages of the project.\n"

    "- **`beers.csv`**: Contains metadata for individual beers, including their name, style, alcohol by volume (ABV), availability status, and descriptive notes.\n",
    "- **`breweries.csv`**: Includes information about each brewery, such as its name, geographic location (city, state, country), and type (e.g., brewery, bar, store).\n",
    "- **`reviews.csv`**: A substantial dataset with over 9 million user-generated reviews. Each entry features ratings for five sensory attributes (look, smell, taste, feel, overall), accompanying review text, the reviewerâ€™s username, and a timestamp.\n",
    "\n",
    "The datasets are read using `pandas.read_csv()` with UTF-8 encoding. The `low_memory=False` flag is applied to ensure reliable type inference, particularly given the file size of the reviews dataset. Upon successful loading, representative samples from each DataFrame are printed to confirm the structure and contents.\n"

    "## Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "This section performs a full data preparation pipeline across the `beers`, `breweries`, and `reviews` datasets. The key steps are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Data Cleaning\n",
    "- **Duplicate Removal**: Duplicate entries are dropped from all three datasets to prevent data leakage or skewed analysis.\n",
    "- **Missing Value Handling**:\n",
    "  - `state` and `country` fields are imputed with `\"Unknown\"` where missing.\n",
    "  - `abv` (alcohol by volume) and `score` (user rating) are imputed with their respective median values.\n",
    "  - Empty review texts are replaced with an empty string (`\"\"`).\n",
    "  - Missing `user_id` values are encoded as `-1` to denote unidentified users.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Feature Encoding\n",
    "- **Label Encoding** is applied to categorical variables:\n",
    "  - `style` and `availability` (from `beers`)\n",
    "  - `country` (from `breweries`)\n",
    "- **Feature Scaling**:\n",
    "  - `abv` and `score` are normalized to the [0, 1] range using `MinMaxScaler` for better compatibility with learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Data Merging\n",
    "- `beers` and `breweries` are merged on `brewery_id` using a left join to preserve all beer records.\n",
    "- The combined result is then merged with `reviews` using the beer identifier.\n",
    "- Redundant or unneeded columns (`notes_x`, `notes_y`, `types`, `text`) are dropped to reduce memory usage and improve clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Feature Construction\n",
    "- A new feature `brewery_location` is created by concatenating city, state, and country.\n",
    "- The `retired` field, originally in `t/f` format, is mapped to binary `1/0` values for modeling convenience.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Output\n",
    "The resulting dataset, `beer_reviews_data`, is exported to a CSV file named `cleaned_beer_reviews_data.csv` and a preview is displayed for verification.\n",
    "\n",
    "These preprocessing steps ensure that the dataset is well-structured, numerically encoded, and ready for downstream modeling tasks such as training recommender systems.\n"

    "\n",
    "Following the loading of the cleaned dataset (`cleaned_beer_reviews_data.csv`), a high-level overview was conducted using `.info()`, `.describe()`, and `.isnull().sum()` to assess structure, statistical properties, and missingness within the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dataset Size**: The dataset contains approximately 9.1 million records and 32 columns. This includes both original attributes (e.g., `abv`, `style`, `look`, `taste`) and engineered features (e.g., `style_encoded`, `abv_normalized`, `score_normalized`).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Types**: There is a mix of numerical, categorical, and textual features. Float columns dominate the rating features, while identifiers and descriptive fields are held as integers or strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Missing Values**:\n",
    "  - Over **3.8 million reviews** are missing detailed tasting scores (`look`, `smell`, `taste`, `feel`, `overall`), likely reflecting partial user feedback.\n",
    "  - Approximately **49,000 entries** are missing values for `beer_id`, `score`, and `score_normalized`, likely due to incomplete merges or filtering.\n",
    "  - A small number of entries are missing in fields such as `style` (2 records), `notes_beer` (2,765), and `notes_brewery` (5,092).\n",
    "  - Approximately **53,000 reviews** are missing the `username`, which limits the ability to conduct personalized or collaborative filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Score Distribution**: Most rating features (including the composite `score`) follow a near-normal distribution centered around 4.0, with a maximum of 5.0. The `score_normalized` ranges from 0 to 1, providing a scaled variant for downstream models.\n",
    "\n",
    "These findings inform the next stage of the pipelineâ€”namely, filtering incomplete records and constructing a balanced dataset for model training. Fields with critical missing values (e.g., review scores, user IDs) may be excluded, while textual fields (e.g., notes) may be imputed or ignored based on model requirements.\n"

    "## Alcohol Content vs. Beer Ratings\n",
    "\n",
    "A scatter plot was generated to visualize the relationship between a beerâ€™s alcohol by volume (ABV) and its average user rating (`score`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Observations:\n",
    "- **Concentration at Lower ABV**: Most beers in the dataset fall within the 0%â€“20% ABV range, which aligns with typical commercial brewing practices.\n",
    "- **Sparse High-ABV Entries**: A small number of beers exhibit unusually high ABV values (above 40%), which may be outliers or non-standard entries.\n",
    "- **No Strong Correlation**: Visually, there is no clear linear or monotonic relationship between ABV and user ratings. Highly rated beers are present across the full ABV spectrum.\n",
    "- **Potential Outliers**: Extremely high ABV values (above 60%) may warrant further inspection or removal in downstream analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chart suggests that while ABV is an important beer attribute, it does not strongly influence overall user ratings in isolation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Distribution of Beer Ratings\n",
    "\n",
    "The distribution of beer rating scores was visualized using a histogram with kernel density estimation (KDE) overlay.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Observations:\n",
    "- **Rating Bias Toward Higher Scores**: The distribution is right-skewed, with the majority of reviews falling between scores of **3.5 and 4.5**, peaking sharply at **4.0**.\n",
    "- **Sparse Low Ratings**: Ratings below 3.0 are relatively rare, indicating that users are generally lenient or that poor-quality beers receive fewer reviews.\n",
    "- **Multi-Modal Structure**: The KDE line reveals subtle peaks within the high-score range, potentially reflecting user rating tendencies influenced by platform behavior or cultural biases (e.g., favoring round numbers like 4.0 or 4.5).\n",
    "\n",
